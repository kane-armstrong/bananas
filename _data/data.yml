      company: Valocity Ltd
      logo: valocity-logo.png
      details: |
        Senior Software Engineer and Technical Lead at Valocity on the global platform team. I was responsible
        for designing and implementing the next generation of the product and leading a team of developers/testers
        to deliver this product to a large market.
          - Designed and implemented the solution and software architecture for the next generation
          of the core product. This was designed to be scalable both technically, in order to support
          thousands of concurrent users, and organizationally, in terms of enabling multiple teams to work
          on the same components and to ship these across different geographic boundaries.
          - Worked with business and technical stakeholders to establish sensible service boundaries,
          and used these discussions to inform the design of microservices and decision making around 
          pattern adoption (DDD, CQRS, event patterns, and others) 
          - Streamlined development of microservices by building domain-agnostic templates that covered
          typical boilerplate code, including request validation and RFC 7807 mappings, globalization 
          and localization, OIDC authentication with permission-based authorization policies, logging and
          telemetry, light-weight encapsulation of Entity Framework, database migrations, and more. 
          - Streamlined the build and release process by implementing gitops-style, multi-stage, gated release 
          pipelines in both GitLab and Azure DevOps, using a combination of shell scripts, YAML, kubectl 
          and helm.
          - Improved adherence to the principle of least privilege in CI/CD processes by shifting secrets
          out of source control and CI/CD products, and into KeyVault, in conjunction with Azure AD
          Pod Identity to allow pods to run as service principals.
          - Improved software test processes by teaching developers how to write high-value tests, how to 
          avoid brittle tests, and how to effectively use popular libraries such as Moq, AutoFixture, xUnit,
          and in the case of integration testing, WebAppliactionFactory, Respawn, and Puppeteer.
          - Designed and implemented an identity platform, using ASP.NET Core 2.2, IdentityServer 4, and 
          ASP.NET Identity Core, and extended this so support SAML 2p SSO
